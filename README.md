# üßëüèø‚Äçüíª  About me
I am a Cybersecurity Specialist with strong expertise in Application Security and Security Operations (SOC).
Since 2020, I have been actively involved in software development and penetration testing, building secure applications, analyzing threats, and responding to incidents.

As an Application Security Engineer, I focus on identifying vulnerabilities in source code, securing web applications, and integrating security into CI/CD pipelines. My experience includes secure code reviews, threat modeling, SAST/DAST tools, and container security.

As a SOC Analyst, I specialize in incident response, threat hunting, memory and malware analysis, and SIEM log correlation. I have hands-on experience with tools like Volatility, Wireshark, ELK, Wazuh, and Splunk, Malware analysis  and I actively use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map adversary techniques.

With a dual background in software engineering and security operations, I bring a holistic approach to protecting systems ‚Äî from writing secure code to defending against advanced cyber threats.
